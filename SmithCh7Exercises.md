After reading that solutions to the exercises in the *Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith (copyright 1896) are not available, I decided to see if I could draft possible answers subject to review by anybody with an interest in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

The book is available in HTML format at [https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/31277/pg31277-images.html](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/31277/pg31277-images.html)

I stick closely to the vocabulary in the part of the book up to where the exercises are.

This is the second set of exercises in the book and comes from Chapter VII.  They are in Section ##### of the Grammar.
