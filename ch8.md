These are draft solutions to exercises in the
*Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith
(copyright 1896) subject to review by anybody with an interest
in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

This is the third set of exercises in the book and comes
from Chapter VIII, Section 42 of the Grammar.

I stick closely to the vocabulary in the part of the book
up to where the exercises are.

(A post for the first set of exercises is at [C. Alphonso Smith Grammar Chapter VI Section 30 exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldEnglish/comments/1pybft1/c_alphonso_smith_grammar_chapter_vi_section_30/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).)
