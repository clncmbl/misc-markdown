These are draft solutions to exercises in the
*Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith
(copyright 1896) subject to review by anybody with an interest
in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

This is for the fourth set of exercises in the book, which comes
from Chapter IX, Section 55 of the Grammar.
