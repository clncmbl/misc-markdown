These are draft solutions to exercises in the
*Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith
(copyright 1896) subject to review by anybody with an interest
in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

This is for the fourth set of exercises in the book, which comes
from Chapter IX, Section 55 of the Grammar.

up to where the exercises are.
