These are draft solutions to exercises in the
*Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith
(copyright 1896) subject to review by anybody with an interest
in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

This is for the third set of exercises in the book, which comes
from Chapter VIII, Section 42 of the Grammar.
