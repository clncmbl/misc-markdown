After reading that solutions to the exercises in the *Anglo-Saxon Grammar and Exercise Book* by C. Alphonso Smith (copyright 1896) are not available, I decided to see if I could draft possible answers subject to review by anybody with an interest in checking them over.  I would appreciate corrections and additions.

The book is available in HTML format at [https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/31277/pg31277-images.html](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/31277/pg31277-images.html)

I stick closely the vocabulary in the book, itself, up to where the exercises are.

These exercises from Chapter VI are the first exercises in the book.  They are in Section 30 of the Grammar.
